## 4. ðŸ“– <a name='Usage'></a>Usage

In a manner to use a sample of data sent in the test I used a msw tool to mock requests response. With that, I was able to implement the ui with a backend representation where the request make from chart-challenge will get a proper data.

The frontend from this challenge is a simple one, it uses interactive charts and it was created a toolbox with metrics by time.

When clicked in the metrics time and selecting one of the options: by hour, by minutes, by secs, it will convert from one to other and update te charts bellow:

- Downtime in last shift
- Availability in last shift
